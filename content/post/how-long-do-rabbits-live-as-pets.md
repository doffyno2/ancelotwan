<p>As animal lovers, we all want to ensure that our pets live long and healthy lives. If you're considering adopting a rabbit as a pet, one of the questions you might be asking yourself is, "How long do rabbits live?" In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the factors that can influence a rabbit's lifespan and give you tips on how to ensure that your bunny lives a long and happy life.</p>

<h2>Factors That Affect a Rabbit's Lifespan</h2>

<p>There are several factors that can influence how long a rabbit lives, including:</p>

<h3>Breed</h3>

<p>Some rabbit breeds are more long-lived than others. For example, smaller breeds like the Netherland Dwarf tend to live longer than larger breeds like the Flemish Giant.</p>

<h3>Genetics</h3>

<p>Genetics can play a role in a rabbit's lifespan. If a rabbit comes from a line of long-lived rabbits, it may be more likely to live a long life as well.</p>

<h3>Diet</h3>

<p>A rabbit's diet can have a big impact on its health and lifespan. A diet that is high in fresh hay and fresh vegetables can help keep a rabbit healthy and can prevent health problems that can shorten its life.</p>
