<h2>What are Tea Pets?</h2>

<p>Tea pets, also known as tea mascots or tea companions, are small figurines made from various materials such as clay, porcelain, or metal. They come in different shapes and designs, ranging from animals to mythical creatures to everyday objects. Some tea pets are modeled after famous characters from Chinese folklore, such as the Monkey King or the Eight Immortals.</p>

<p>Tea pets are usually placed on the tea tray or tea table during a tea ceremony, and they are believed to bring good luck and positive energy to the tea session. They are also used as a way to express gratitude to the tea gods and to honor the tea spirit. Some tea pets are even given names and personalities by their owners, who treat them like real pets.</p>

<h2>History of Tea Pets</h2>

<p>The origin of tea pets can be traced back to the Tang dynasty (618-907 AD), when tea drinking became a popular pastime among the aristocracy and the literati. It was during this time that tea ware and tea accessories began to evolve into artistic forms. Tea pets were initially made from clay or mud and were used as tools to clean teapots and tea cups. They were also used as a form of entertainment, as people would make the clay figurines and then smash them during tea sessions for fun.</p>

<p>During the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 AD), tea pets became more refined and began to take on decorative and symbolic roles in tea ceremonies. They were often made from porcelain or jade and were shaped like animals or mythical creatures. Tea pets were believed to have the power to purify the tea and to protect the tea drinkers from harm.</p>

<p>In the Qing dynasty (1644-1912 AD), tea pets became even more popular and were considered an essential part of the tea ceremony. They were often placed on the tea tray alongside the teapot and tea cups, and they were treated with great respect and reverence. Tea pets were also used as a way to socialize and connect with other tea lovers, as people would exchange tea pets as gifts or trade them with each other.</p>

<h2>Types of Tea Pets</h2>

<p>There are many types of tea pets, each with its unique features and meanings. Here are some of the most common types:</p>

<h3>Animal Tea Pets</h3>

<p>Animal tea pets are the most popular type of tea pets and come in various forms such as cats, dogs, rabbits, and dragons. They are often cute and whimsical, and they are believed to bring joy and happiness to the tea session. Some animal tea pets are also based on the Chinese zodiac, with each animal representing a different year.</p>

<h3>Mythical Creature Tea Pets</h3>

<p>Mythical creature tea pets are inspired by Chinese folklore and legends, such as the Dragon and the Phoenix. They are often majestic and intricate, with intricate details and colors. Mythical creature tea pets are believed to bring power and protection to the tea session, and they are often given as gifts to loved ones or used as a symbol of good fortune.</p>

<h3>Buddhist Tea Pets</h3>

<p>Buddhist tea pets are inspired by Buddhist teachings and themes, such as the Buddha or the Bodhisattva. They are often peaceful and serene, and they are believed to bring spiritual enlightenment to the tea session.
